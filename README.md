# Ray-Tracing-Acceleration-Data-Structures-Point-Lights
Nori based implementation of an octree, a hierarchical data structure that enables fast ray intersection computations involving very large numbers of triangles. In addition, we are implementing a simple shading model using a single point light.

Note: To run the code please see https://github.com/hsouri/nori-base-2019. Replace include and src files with the folders given in this repo and run!
